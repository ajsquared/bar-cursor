# bar-cursor #

## Introduction ##

color-theme-x is an Emacs Lisp package that changes the Emacs cursor
from a block into a bar.  In overwrite-mode, the cursor will change
into a block.

I forked color-theme-x from the file by Joseph L. Casadonte Jr. found on
[his webpage](http://www.northbound-train.com/emacs.html#MyPackages).

## Installation ##

1. Place bar-cursor.el somewhere on your Emacs load path.
2. Add (require 'bar-cursor) to your .emacs
3. Add (bar-cursor-mode 1) to your .emacs

color-theme-x.el is also available in Marmalade.  If you have
package.el set up, simply run M-x package-install bar-cursor to
install.  See the [Marmalade page](http://marmalade-repo.org/) for
setup instructions.
